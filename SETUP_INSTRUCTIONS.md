# 🚀 Admin Dashboard Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- XAMPP installed and running
- Apache and MySQL services started in XAMPP Control Panel

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Database Setup
1. Open **phpMyAdmin** in your browser: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Import the database structure:
   - Click on **"Import"** tab
   - Choose file: `database.sql`
   - Click **"Go"** to execute
   - This will create the `bulwagan_db` database and `pending_audition` table

### 2. Test Database Connection
1. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost/Project(1)/admin.php`
2. If you see the admin dashboard (even with empty table), the connection is working!

### 3. Add Sample Data (Optional)
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost/Project(1)/sample_data.php`
2. This will insert 8 sample audition records for testing
3. Refresh the admin dashboard to see the sample data
